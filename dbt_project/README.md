# dbt Project

## Overview
This dbt project is designed to transform and analyze data using various models, tests, and macros. It includes staging, intermediate, and marts models to facilitate a structured approach to data transformation.

## Project Structure
- **models/**: Contains the transformation models.
  - **staging/**: Staging models with their schema definitions.
  - **intermediate/**: Intermediate models that build upon the staging models.
  - **marts/**: Final models for reporting and analysis.
  
- **tests/**: Contains SQL test cases to validate the models.
  
- **macros/**: Reusable SQL macros for simplifying complex queries.
  
- **seeds/**: Seed data for testing and development.
  
- **analyses/**: SQL queries for generating insights from the data.
  
- **snapshots/**: Snapshots of data for historical comparisons.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dbt and any necessary dependencies.
3. Configure your database connection in the `dbt_project.yml` file.
4. Run `dbt run` to execute the models.
5. Use `dbt test` to validate the models with the provided test cases.

## Usage
After setting up the project, you can run the models and analyses to generate insights from your data. Use the macros to simplify your SQL queries and ensure data quality with the tests provided.
